# Pangolin

This is yet another job scheduler for .NET Framework. It's still in alpha and not production ready.

I have used other job schedulers in ecosystem in many projects. I found them ceremonial and hard to configure.
They are somehow lacking multiple instance support.

This is not a competitor of them. This is a hobby project of me. 

In near future, I want to add Masstransit support and an EF Core provider to support DBs.

Enjoy.
